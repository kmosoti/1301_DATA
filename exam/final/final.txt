1) I switch doors as now my chance of picking the correct door is 11% differing from the 10% before the goat door reveal. So Yes, my odds of picking the corret door would increase

2) a, d, g, i

3A) Assembly 

3B) No. It's assembled.

4) Matlab's ancestor is C++, while Python's is C.

5) The uncertainty is inherent to the experiment and can't be reduced to anything else as it is aleatoric.

6) - Normal Distribution (Gaussian)
   - Poisson Distribution
   
7) 1/6 * 2/6 = 2/36

8) - Classical
   - Bayesian
   - Frequentist
   - Propensity/Axiomatic
   
9) Bayesian as when data is scarse complicated measures are taken into place to make up for the lack of data.

10) - Computational Physics - Uncertainty Quantification
	- Computational Science - Machine Learning/Optimization
	- Biomedical - Simulation of prosthetics

11) A /down B = A' ^ B'
	A /down B = (A /down A) ^  /down B)
	A /down B = (A /down B) ^ (B /down A) --Since the should all equal false
	A /down B = (A + B)' -- CHECK
	
12) Qualitative - Used to distinguish items without an intrinsic order
	Sequential - Used to represent data values with a uniform relationship
	Diverging - To show the deviation of data values with at least two directions from a mid point.
	Accent - For a dataset which you need to mark key information and distinguish it from the rest of the set of data.
	
13) In the case someone is color blind (RED-GREEN which is popular). They would not be completely lost. Use colors that are direct opposites on the spectrum of colors.
