1)

2) Normal Distribution

3) 1/36

4) 3/6

5) Uniform Dispersion Chart.

6) Correlation does not neccessarily mean causation. Though they can exist at the same time.
	A lot of the time causation cannot be assumed from a correlation because too many factors are in play.
	For example, you started making your coffee with a new sweetner called XYZ. You observe that
	your rates of selling have skyrocketing. You assume that the use of XYZ has caused your sales to increase
	but the fact could be that it's the sweet taste that the customers like not neccessarily just XYZ.
	
7) Independece between variables cannot be assumed by correlation. Infact, as humans, we'd assume
	causation naturally. For example, you observe that over time women attending an event seem
	to be getting taller. You also observe that highheels over time are increasing in height.
	It's easy to see how you can't imply these variables to be independent.

8) Aesthetics in data visualization are the features of a graphic representing data.
	Exampls of these Aesthetics are as follows: Position, Size, Color, and line width.

9) Two Major Classes of Aesthetics:
	1) Discrete Aesthetics
	2) COntinuous
	
10) Types of Data:
	 1) Quantitative - Ex. The weights of individual grapes
	 2) Qualitative - Ex. Color of a set of cars.
	 
11) Factors.

12) Ordered Data: Average height of Hospital Buildings
	Unordered Data: Average height of any structure
	
13) The independent/dependent variables should be on axies with the same units and grid size

15)	Data that is periodic in nature

16) ColorBrewerBlues
	Heat
	Carto Earth
	
17) Should be a bar graph or scatter plot. Difficult to visual the data.
